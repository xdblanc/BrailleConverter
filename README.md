# Braille Conversion Application

The Braille Conversion Application is a graphical user interface (GUI) program built in Python using the tkinter library. It allows users to convert text to braille and vice versa, as well as convert spoken words to braille using speech recognition.

## Features

- Text to Braille Conversion: Enter text in the provided input field and click the "CONVERT" button to convert it to braille. The converted braille output will be displayed on the screen.

- Braille to Text Conversion: Enter braille characters in the input field to convert them back to text. The converted text will be displayed on the screen.

- Speech to Braille Conversion: Click the microphone button in the Speech Page to start the speech recognition feature. Speak into your microphone, and the application will convert your spoken words to braille.
